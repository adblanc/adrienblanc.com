### About the project

This was the last project of the common branch of my 42 cursus, we were a group of 4. <br />
We had to build a [Single Page Application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singlepage_application) using [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), [Backbone.JS](https://backbonejs.org/) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/). <br />
Users should be able to play the famous [pong game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong), have friends, guilds, chat with each other, and a bunch of other features.

### What I learned

#### Ruby on Rails

I never wrote **ruby** nor used **Ruby on Rails** before and I loved it. <br />
It **boosted my productivity** a ton because their is no need to write boilerplate which simplified my life a lot. <br />
However, setting the whole project up was kinda messy at first, especially to get [webpacker](https://github.com/rails/webpacker) to work nicely with everything else.

#### Backbone.js

Coming from [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), developing using **Backbone** was **hard**, **really hard**. <br />
I had just so much more things to handle myself, managing views lifecycles, remove events, and so much more... <br />
Nevertheless, it increased my **web knowledge** tremendously.

As I **love Typescript**, I had to try to fit it in and I did. <br />
Looking back on it, I don't know if it was a good decision as in my group I was the only one with **javascript** and **typescript** knowledge. <br />
Of course, **typescript** helped us a lot by providing **static analysis** on the codebase but it added complexity for my mates.
Moreover, **99%** of backbone examples online were not using **ES6 classes**, and of course were written in javascript.

#### OAuth

It was my first time implementing an **OAuth authentication** ever. <br />
I used the **42 API**, and I really enjoyed it. <br />
The fact that you don't have to worry about **storing the users password** or even the signup logic, is of great help.

#### Websockets

Ruby on Rails comes with a lovely library to handle websockets : **Action Cable**. <br />
It has a **nice API** and allowed me to add real time updates to the website. <br />
I used it to build the **real time chat interface** and also for the **pong game** itself. <br />
My previous experiences with websockets were limited and it was my first time building a chat.

### Notes

This was my biggest 42 project so far, I **loved it** but I do have some regrets :

- not introducing unit and integration tests sooner.
- not taking enough time to choose my mates, out of our 4 people group, only 2 of us were **really** working on it so it was not cool nor motivating.
