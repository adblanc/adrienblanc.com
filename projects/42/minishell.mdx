### About

The objective of this project is to create a "simple" shell. <br />
It is the first group project in my 42 cursus, we were 2. <br />
We had to implement 6 builtins like in [bash](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)>) :

- echo (with -n option)
- cd
- pwd
- export
- unset
- env
- exit

Also, we had to handle redirections, pipes, environment variables and some signals.

### What I learnt

It deepened my understanding of the terminal which is my everyday working tool.<br />
I learnt **a lot** about **file descriptors**, **forking processes** and **interprocess communication** which were kinda obscur to me. <br />
There is **a ton** of resources about those, but here are a few I'd recommend :

- [Understanding pipes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHH7nHkgZ4w)
- [Understanding fd, dup and dup2 system calls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqndHT606Tw)
- [Understanding fork system call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVSPv-9x3gk)
- [Write a shell in C](https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/)

### Notes

I really enjoyed working on this project. <br />
This project was subject to 42 C norm so I didn't have to adapt my writing style to my mate.
