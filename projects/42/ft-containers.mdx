### About the project

The containers in C++ all have a very different usage. <br />
To make sure I understand them all, let's re-implement them! <br />
I had to implement using C++98 and with the help of [this reference](https://www.cplusplus.com/) the following containers :

- List
- Vector
- Map
- Stack
- Queue

I also made so bonus containers:

- Set
- Multiset
- Multimap

Of course, STL (standard template library) is forbidden. <br />
However STD (standard) library was allowed.

### What I learned

#### A bunch of data structures

Before this project, the only data structure that I experimented with was [singly linked list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list#Singly_linked_list). <br/>

In order to implement the **List container**, I had to learn about [doubly circular linked
list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list#Doubly_linked_list).

For the **Map container** , binary trees and more specifically [red black
trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree).

#### C++

Re-implementing containers and their [iterators](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/iterator/) demystified the STL and really increased my expertise in C++.

#### Test driven development

I made a **lot of unit tests** as there was **a bunch of functions** to test and tried my best to follow [TDD practices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development). <br/>
Unfortunately, it was forbidden in this project to use a C++ testing library, so in order to run my tests I had to use [assert](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cassert/assert/) which made the whole process really redundant (and painful).

### Notes

Re-implementing existing containers wasn't meaningful to me so I found it to be boring sometimes.<br />
However, I really enjoyed researching, learning about **data structures** and making **TDD**.
