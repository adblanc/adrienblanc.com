### About the project

This project serves as an introduction to [multithreading](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multithreading_(computer_architecture)>). <br />
The purpose was to build 3 different programs to solve [the dining philosophers problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem), each with different constraints.

### What I learned

#### Parallelism

Never had I developed multithreaded programs before this project. <br />
It gave me the **opportunity** to learn about [threads](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)>), [mutex](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)>) and [semaphores](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaphore_(programming)>). <br />

### Notes

Multithreading **adds some complexity** to the code structure but it was pleasant to learn.
