### About the project

This project is about clusturing docker applications and deploying it with [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io).
I had to set up a multi-service cluster including:

- A Kubernetes web dashboard
- A [Load Balancer](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancing_(computing)>)
- A [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) website with a [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) database.
- A [phpMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/)
- A [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) server answering to both http and https.
- A [FTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTPS) server.
- A [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) platform connected to an [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/) database.

It looks something like this:

### What I learned

#### Kubernetes

It was my first experience with Kubernetes, I had never heard of it. <br />
I learned to manage different services inside the same cluster and make them work nicely together. <br />
I find K8s to have a **steep learning curve**, there is a bunch of different concepts to learn such as pods, services, volumes, deployments which implies to read a large amount of documentation.

#### yaml

I had always used [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) but this project introduced me to [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML). **I hate it**.<br />
JSON doesn't care if you have an extra or missing tabulation, YAML do. <br />
Having 15+ yaml files in this project, I got frustrated **a lot**.

### Notes

I can't imagine myself as a **system administrator** because it doesn't fullfil me. <br />
However, I'm grateful for having the opportunity to work on this project as it developed my knowledge and my skills in a domain that even though I'm not a fan of, is still important.
