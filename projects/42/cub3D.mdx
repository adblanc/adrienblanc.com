### About the project

This project is the first game that I developed ðŸ˜Š, it is inspired by the world-famous eponymous 90's game [Wolfenstein 3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D), which was the first FPS ever.

### What I learned

#### Graphic library

I had to use the **miniLibX** graphic library which I think is developed by a 42 staff member. <br />
I had never used a graphic library before but it appeared to me that this one was a really **minimalistic and low-level one**. <br />
There was little resources online but thanks to the man pages and other 42 students I managed to get the hang of it. <br />

#### Ray casting

I used this [wonderful tutorial](https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html) to implement [ray casting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_casting). <br />
Even though I studied maths for 1 year after graduation, I had never applied "complex" **maths algorithms** in my projects, it gave me this exact opportunity and I enjoyed it. <br />

### Notes

I found this project fun to work on and satistying as you see direct results. <br />
