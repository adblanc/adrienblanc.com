### About the project

It was a **huge** group project and we were 2 working on it. <br />
We had to build a [non blocking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_I/O) HTTP 1.1 server, written in **C++ 98** and conditionally compliant with the **HTTP RFC** [7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230) to [7235](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7235).

### What I learned

#### Sockets

Using a **configuration file** that we would parse, our server had to connect and listen on some specific ports. <br />
Through a personal project, I had already used sockets in a websocket protocol, for example using [socket.io](https://socket.io/) in Node.JS but this project was totally different. <br />
We had to use **low level C sockets functions** and on the top of that sockets had to be non-blocking.
If you want to read more about these I'd **strongly** recommend [this website](http://dwise1.net/pgm/sockets/blocking.html).

#### Hypertext TransferProtocol (HTTP)

We went through **a lot** of **HTTP headers** which allowed me to grasp the importance of each and every one of them.

#### NGINX

In the subject, **nginx** was considered HTTP 1.1 compliant and could be used to compare headers and answer behaviors. <br />
In order to test our server, I dug in nginx documentation and tested their server as well. <br />
Note also that **nginx source code** is written **in C** and publicly available on [github](https://github.com/nginx/nginx).

#### CGI

[Common Gateway Interface (CGI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface) was a **great** part of this project. <br />
I knew nothing about it but I found it really interesting. <br />
To summarize, we launch a **new process** to execute a program that will **interpret the request** and **handle** the related file. <br />
A common example would be the **PHP CGI** to display a web page when navigating on an `.php` link.

### Notes

This project took us way longer than expected because of the **COVID-19**. <br />
Nevertheless, I enjoyed working on it because I learned **enormously**.
