### About the project

A quick introductory project using assembly language with 6 functions to code :

- strlen
- strcpy
- strcmp
- write
- read
- strdup

### Obstacles

At first, I really had some issues understanding registers and their differencies.
An other obstacle was that the project had to be done only using **64 bits ASM** and run on **macOS**. Some great resources on internet could be using a 32 bits version or not be portable to macOS as the **[system calls](https://sigsegv.pl/osx-bsd-syscalls/)** can differ.

### What I learned

I learned to read and write assembly code.<br />
It gave me a whole new understanding of low level programming and what is happening under the hood of most programs.

### Notes

I found this project useful as I have an interest in reverse engineering and sometimes find myself reading assembly code.
