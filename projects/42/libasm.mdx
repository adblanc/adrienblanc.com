### About

A quick introductory project using assembly language with 6 functions to code :

- strlen
- strcpy
- strcmp
- write
- read
- strdup

### Obstacles

At first, I really had some troubles understanding registers and their differencies.
An other obstacle was that the project had to be done using **64 bits ASM** and run on **macOS**. Some great resources on internet could be using a 32 bits version or not be portable to macOS as the **[system calls](https://sigsegv.pl/osx-bsd-syscalls/)** can differ.

### What I learnt

I learnt to read and write assembly code.<br />
It gave me a new understanding of low level programming and what is happening under the hood of most programs.

### Notes

I found this project useful as I like reverse engineering and sometimes find myself reading assembly code.
