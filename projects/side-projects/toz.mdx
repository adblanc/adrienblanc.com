## What is it

TOZ is my first **react native** project, it is an application regrouping multiple alcohol games.<br />
It is availaible on both the _[App Store](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/toz-jeux-dalcool-en-soir%C3%A9e/id1476978964#?platform=iphone)_ and _[Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blincio.toz&hl=fr&gl=US)_ and has more than **200K downloads 🥳**.

## What I learned

#### React Native

I started writing it while learning react native, it helped me a lot to build a real project to learn the fundamentals. <br />
I develop it using [Expo](https://expo.io/), it comes with a nice developer experience and facilitate **a lot** of things.
However, I might in the futur eject from **Expo** to have more freedom over my app bundle, native libraries etc...

#### Typescript

As I decided to learn **Typescript**, I rebuilt **TOZ** using it. <br />
I was suprised by the number of **small bugs** I found when converting the code, and since then I can't live without it 👉👈.

#### React Native tests

[Jest](https://jestjs.io/) library is my go to when **testing javascript/typescript** so I used it here as well. <br />
On top of it, I use [React Native Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-native-testing-library/intro/), it was the perfect opportunity for me to dig deeper in **testing my react (native or not) projects 👌**.

#### Internationalization 🇫🇷 🇬🇧 🇪🇸 🇩🇪

I never had the opportunity to internationalize a project before. <br />
I used `i18n-js` library and translated the application in **4 different languages**.

#### React hooks and context

In the first version of **TOZ**, I used **class components**. <br />
However, after moving from **javascript** to **typescript** I also studied **function components**, **hooks** and **context**. <br />
Since then, I never came back to **class components** as I love **react hooks**.

#### Dealing with third parties

This is not related to programming but is still a **huge** part of **creating an application from scratch**. <br />
Publishing an app on the **App Store** and the **Play Store** isn't fun, there is a lot of rules and guidelines to follow. <br />
Nevertheless, it is a **great experience**.

#### A lot more

Animations, assets storage, over the air updates, monetization etc...

## Notes

TOZ is **still in development** and I aim to release regular updates 👍.
